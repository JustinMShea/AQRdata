Description: This R package provides access to return series from hypothetical 
  portfolios in academic articles by AQR researchers. Datasets include long-only 
  excess returns and long/short factor premia, with varying granularity and both 
  monthly and daily returns. Each dataset links to a specific paper, reflecting 
  returns to portfolios as described, not live returns or backtests of AQR 
  portfolios. Users should cite “AQR Capital Management, LLC.”
